                </h3>
                <p>I enjoy building web-based products/businesses. I’m fortunate enough to be able to do (most of) this with my day job, at Zipari, where I lead a team to build customer experience products for the Health Insurance industry. </p>
                <p>I’m always working on side projects, as an “indie-hacker,” when I have the time. I find building businesses end-to-end very challenging, but also exciting/rewarding - there’s nothing like seeing that first Stripe payment come through. You can find a list of these below. </p>

                <p>Below is a list of current/past projects I’ve worked on as “indie projects.” Some of these I’ve taken more seriously than others, but they were all shipped.</p>

                <h4>Current</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.emailcapture.io">EmailCapture.io</a> (2020 - ) - This is a simple drop-in widget to capture visitor emails</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Past</h4>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    BugTower  (2015 - 2019) - A simple SaaS for allowing teams to create and manage software bugs/issues. I built a webapp, iPhone app, and chrome extension. At it’s high, it reached around $900-1000/month.

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    TimeLoggy (2017) - MacOS app, built on Harvest time tracking. The app allowed you to record time offline (Harvest’s desktop app didn’t/doesn’t?) and sync back up when you are logged in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    TimeSheet Tracker (2016 - 2017) - A simple iPhone app for recording your time, then exporting your time entries to a csv. This was for contractors on the go. Built this on parse.com (as the backend), but shut it down once Parse closed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mock Interview (2015) - iPhone app that helps you prepare for an interview, where you are asked interview questions over audio and your response is recorded. You can then listen to your response after.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Audio Sleep Timer (2014 - 2017) - iPhone app to add music from your music library onto a playlist, set a time, then fall asleep to your music.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    How to Get The Job & Beat the Competition (2011 - ?) - Ebook/Kindle book to help prepare for an interview. Still for sale on Amazon and I get a sale every 6 months or so..
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    HelpMyStomach (2011 - 2012) - A forum/community for people dealing with stomach issues. I launched this with Joomla. Back at the time, I had stomach issues and got more insight from reading about what others did vs. any sort of doctor recommendations.
                  </li>
